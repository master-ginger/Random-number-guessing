This code randomnly selects a number in a given range and the computer stors it
then you are asked to guess a number
if the number you guessed is the number stored in computer then you win
else you will be notified if your number is less or greater
Also, you have a limited number of guesses depending upon your range

I have used logarithmic function to calculate the number of guesses
